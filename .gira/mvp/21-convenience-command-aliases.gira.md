# Convenience command aliases

Alias high-level commands to common lower ones, to invoke quicker

# features

* `gira list` to list all?
* doing stuff to single ticket numbers
    * `gira start [ticket]` to start a specific ticket number?
    * `gira edit [ticket]` to edit a specific ticket number?

are they all `search` subcommands?
